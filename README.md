# Limp
My own virtual microprocessor customized

# The Assembler
For now:
* Just puts your source file in the same directory as the assembler executable with name "test.asm"
* Executes and, if has no any error, will generates a file called output.o
* Starts the Limp and loads the file generate as memory file
* Test it

Has no guide or tutorial about to programming to it, the only sources are the excel file with the project description, and the json file with the opcodes and its properties described, you can also try use the file "test.asm" to generate a truly working program.
